## where and how can we deploy 

we can deploy on [vercel]() and [netlify]() and there is many other option but for now i just used these platform 

<i> steps involve in deploying :-</i>

- visit to the website [vercel]() or [netlify]()
- create your accout 
- connect to github 
- import the project you want to deploy 
- And wait for some time as these platform will install packages and deploy automatically 
- Now everything done you are good to go  tada!
